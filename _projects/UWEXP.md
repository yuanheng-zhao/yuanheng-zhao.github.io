[UW EXP](https://make4all.org/uwexperience/) is a student health and wellness study which applies surveys and biometrics to learn about how personal and academic stressors affect student wellness. Our goal is to guide University of Washington students and administration in addressing student stress and mental health to improve the Husky Experience.

From 2019 to 2020, I was working on the UWEXP study to help improve the way of handling and processing research data. The following is a presentation of my previous work about improving the processing of survey data.
