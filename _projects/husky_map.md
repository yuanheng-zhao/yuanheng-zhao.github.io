During the Data Structures and Algorithms class at Aut 2019, we Implemented a backend
for a route finder tool "**HUSKY MAP**", which searches and displays the shortest path between
a start and end point on the map of school campus.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/googleMap_screenshot.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/huskyMap_screenshot.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>

- Implemented the router finder tool on the map of UW and surrounding areas.

- Incorporated the data structures such as Deques and Heaps and algorithms such as
BinaryRangeSearch for autocomplete and A* (star) search for searching paths learnt in previous weeks.

- Modeled real-world data (locations, buildings, St, etc.) as nodes/edges to support basic functionalities like zooming, locating, and path searching.

- Worked on the given framework with GUI and JUNIT TESTING
