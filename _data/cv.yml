    - title: Software Engineer (AI Compiler, MLIR/LLVM)
      institution: SambaNova Systems Inc
      year: 07/2022 - 03/2023
      description:
        - Interacted and worked with compiler teams at varying layers on the intermediate representations (IRs) using MLIR/LLVM, 
          to ensure reliable dataflow of a custom ML compiler for compiling PyTorch/TensorFlow models running on customized chips.
        - Migrated an intermediate compilation process towards an in-memory code generation, enhancing the performance by about 35% for the stage with strengthened security.
        - Improved and optimized analysis and transform passes used for calculating data layout constraints and modifying IRs, 
          facilitating the compilation success of about 10 various models like GPT-3 and BERT.
        - Added legalization and unit tests into various stages, enhancing stability and robustness of the compiler.
    
    - title: Research Assistant (Data Collection & Data Analysis)
      institution: Make4all Lab, University of Washington
      year: 10/2019 - 10/2020
      description:
        - Worked on research projects at Make4all Lab, University of Washington.
        - Analyzed survey and biometric data collected for the UW EXP Study, a student health and wellness study.
        - Developed codebooks to accurately describe data collected in various phases from 2018-2020 for use in the study, supporting with data analysis and interpretation and drawing meaningful insights from the data.
        - Modified and refined data structures of config files used for 100+ questionnaire items and aggregated scoring items.
        - Collected and prepared data through Scrapy for usage of the analysis.

    - title: Research Assistant (Swarm Robotics Optimization)
      institution: Guangdong Digital Signal and Image Processing Lab, Shantou University
      year: 09/2019
      description:
        - Revised and optimized a control parameters estimation process which regulates swarm aggregation behaviors through Genetic Programming (Python DEAP), 
          which significantly improved the performance of the simulation by 40%.

    - title: Professor of Theoretical Physics
      institution: Shanghai Shudan Information Technology (AFA Finance)
      year: 06/2019 - 08/2019
      description:
      - Worked on a Web Scraping Project which collects and prepares data used for social sentiment analysis and prediction.
      - Designed and developed web crawlers using Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and XPath, which efficiently extracted over 5000 data items daily from scraping various dynamically rendered websites.
      - Developed features bypassing anti-scraping technologies (e.g., dynamic user agents, proxies) for a Scrapy-based distributed web crawler. Successfully increased the number of websites it’s able to gather data from about 150 to over 200.
      - Implemented a dynamic proxy pool using Flask and Redis and connected it to Scrapy downloader middleware.
      - Improved unit test set coverage from 45% to 85% in a codebase of over 18000 lines of production code.
