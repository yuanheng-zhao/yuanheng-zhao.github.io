Hello! This is Yuanheng Zhao (Jonathan), a previous compiler software engineer at SambaNova Systems. 

Academically accomplished at both University of Washington (B.S. in Applied Math) and University of Chicago (M.S. in CS). My areas of interests include Backend, Data Engineering, Compiler Infrastructure, and Machine Learning. Through my previous research and internship works, I mainly practiced with Python and C++. I also have experience in other programming languages (Java, GoLang), cloud (AWS), database (DynamoDB, Redis), message queues (ActiveMQ, ZeroMQ), ML (TensorFlow, sklearn), and web application frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Spring Boot). I am passionate about exploring and learning advanced knowledge of computer science and resolving challenges encountered in work and life. 

Hope we never lose enthusiasm and curiosity to explore different things in our lives!
